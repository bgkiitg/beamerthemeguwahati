Requirements
You will need the following fonts

Chaparral Pro Display   
Fontin
Monaco
Comic Sans MS Regular
Myriad Pro
The easiest way to get the fonts working is to use  XeTeX or LuaTeX and the fontspec package. 
They can use any TTF font installed on the system. 
For Linux this means both the system wide fonts and any fonts you put into ~/.fonts/

Otherwise you may edit the beamerfontthemeguwahati.sty

Installation Instructions

1. For a local installation you can simply copy all files into a folder and start modifying guwahati-example.tex

2. For a system wide installation on Ubuntu/ Linux systems do the following

3. Find the directory where your latex packages are installed
   
    $ kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL

4. On my machine this returned /usr/local/share/texmf

5. Create a new folder to store the theme

    $ sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/beamerguwahati
